Nightfall
---------

I'm attempting to make a game along the lines of [Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident](http://pandagames.biz/Strategy/Spybotics.html), an old Lego Shockwave game that I was fond of. It's not going to be a direct clone, but it will have similar gameplay mechanics. It built on node. So to install, you'll want to download [node](http://nodejs.org/).
