Nightfall
=========

I'm attempting to make a game along the lines of [Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident](http://pandagames.biz/Strategy/Spybotics.html), an old Lego Shockwave game that I was fond of. It's not going to be a direct clone, but it will have similar gameplay mechanics. It built on node.

Installation
------------

Download and install [node and node package manager](http://nodejs.org/).

```
git clone git://github.com/cypressf/nightfall.git
npm install
```
